   ? use paths as the tmux name - and have aliases
      - support tux move Projects/dry/dry-wip/dry-underscore projects/dry/baseline
      - support tux move du projects/dry/baseline

   - support splitting / adjusting windows (basically call the tmux adjust windows script)

   - support array notation in tux sessions to open multiple tabs
      - use tab -d '' <cmd>

   - also support tux tab <name> to start session in a new iterm tab.

   - create a tux init . <name> which will add this directory to the tux.
      - tux init picks the abbreviation. is there a programmatic way to do that? ask chat gpt about the algorithm. it also saves the state. tux save in a tmux session saves the config. https://superuser.com/questions/440015/restore-tmux-session-after-reboot

   - can you name tmux windows?
